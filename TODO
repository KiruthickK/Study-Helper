Things to do
    Make a function like RequireAuth to check the user is logged in or not --done
    Validations for signup 
        password strength
        inputs filled?

Updates to do later
    instead of having many functions that make similar job
    make a same function with addded parameters so that can be reused many number of times
    example : { getNotes, etc in database.js}
